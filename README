The motivation for this repo comes from the follow sentiment:

    Read on on some random blog "I may even release it one day once I clean it up."  Bah!  come on share your dirt people.

Don't keep you code locked away.
 

This is my dumping ground for things before they grow into real projects.

* no planing 
* brain dumps
* Proving ideas
* no regrets
* no barrier of pride

Projects

* grease/ - Use greasemonkey and some CGI to see if a website is pair Networks hosted.
* something else
